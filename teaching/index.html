    <h2>Teaching</h2>
    <div class="teaching-section">
      <p>
        My tenets and goals of teaching derive first from the position of student and have evolved
  through my experience as an instructor of an undergraduate negotiation course. Supplemented by
  experiences assisting with and facilitating management, leadership, and communication courses
  at the undergraduate and master’s levels, I integrate my experiences in multiple roles to establish
  a teaching philosophy and approach that remains open to continuous improvement.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a teacher, my job is not solely to add to students’ existing knowledge and challenge their
  preconceptions, but more importantly, to help build a foundation and provide experience to form
  a broader, more analytical worldview. Through my role as a teacher for a course that students
  take during their time in the education system, I can provide them with knowledge and practical
  tools to help them advance toward their individual goals. In the classroom, I work to maintain a balance of being directive while allowing for independent thinking and creativity.
